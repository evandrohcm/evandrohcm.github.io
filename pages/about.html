  <p>I'm Evandro Macedo, a 21 years old passionate Web Developer. I was born in Jo√£o Pessoa - PB, Brazil, and live here since always. I'm studying Internet Systems Technology at <a href="http://www.ifpb.edu.br/" target="_blank">IFPB</a>, about to graduate this year. Currently working as a intern at a company called <a href="http://www.servicenet.com.br/" target="_blank">ServiceNet</a>.</p>

  <p>I always loved computer stuff since I was a child, but my first met with code was kind of 3 years ago when I got to the university, and I was impressed and wondering why the hell some people had told me that programming is boring and awful. One of my regrets is not having known code earlier, cause I believe it costs time and effort to mastering (like everything in life) and be able to build great things. So, since then, learn new development stuff became a hobby and I'm always trying to get closer to the web community.</p>

  <p>At first, Front-end technologies like <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> were the focus of my studies, because I was very excited in understand how to organize and prepare the information that comes to the users, and think in beautiful interfaces with good user experience as well. But also realized that the data process to generate this information in the Back-end is impressive, and started to study <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, aiming to be able to do both things.</p>

  <p>And what about out of the code world? Well, I always had a dream to live in other cultures, learn other languages, visit a lot of countries and know as many as possible of places in the world. Actually, I'm planning to do that after get my degree. I guess this experience is one of the keys to understand how to build something remarkable in life.</p>
