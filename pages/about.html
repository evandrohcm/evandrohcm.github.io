  <p>I'm Evandro Macedo, a 21 years old passionate Web Developer. I was born in Jo√£o Pessoa - PB, Brazil, and live here since always. I'm studying Internet Systems Technology at IFPB, about to graduate this year. Currently working as a intern at a company called ServiceNet.</p>

  <p>My first met with code was kind of 3 years ago when I got to the university, and I was impressed and wondering why the hell some people had told me that programming is boring and awful. Since then, learn new development stuff became a hobby and I'm always trying to get closer to the web community.</p>
